iamreading is a simple Sencha Touch app for creating and tracking reading goals.

I originally developed this app as a way to help encourage my daughter to read (by tying page/book counts to goals), but have continued to add features in my spare time.  It's my first Sencha Touch app, so really above everything, it's been a playground for learning more about the Sencha Touch framework.

Hope you enjoy!
